Your work is seed ` + "`s-abc123`" + ` in the garden — the brief above is its body, and
you are its tender. Read the body and log with:

    attn seed show s-abc123

Report progress, what you learned, and decisions needed on the log:

    attn seed note s-abc123 -m "<what happened and what you learned>"

Harvest only when the requested outcome is settled — the user accepted the work
or the requested PR merged. If implementation is finished but acceptance or
review is pending, note that and leave the seed open:

    attn seed harvest s-abc123 -m "<what got done>"`
